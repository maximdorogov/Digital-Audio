# Digital-Audio
Digital Audio projects for stm32 cortex microcontrollers

Im interested on high end DSP for musical instruments and audio devices. If you want to collab with this project or give me some info just send me an email

Actually Im working to improve the PCB for the analog front end. My idea is to use an akm CODECS for data acquisition and stm32f407 microcontroller for data processing.
